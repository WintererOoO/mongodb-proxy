Proxy for MongoDB which can filter certain operations from MongoDB.

This can, for example, be used to enforce a read-only database.

Filter opcodes by passing the -o option when running. Multiple -o options can be provided if filtering multiple opcodes. 
The opcodes can be found at http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Mongo+Wire+Protocol

To run:
mvn package (will build mongoproxy-*.jar in target/)

java -server -jar target/mongoproxy-1.jar


The proxy is built on the Grizzly NIO framework:
